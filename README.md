<!-- include_open_start -->

Reward is a Swiss Army knife CLI utility for orchestrating Docker based development environments. It makes possible to
run multiple local environments simultaneously without port conflicts by utilizing common services proxying requests to
the correct environment's containers.

Reward is written in Go, and it supports Linux, macOS and Windows (and WSL2).
