## FAQ

* Can I use on Windows?

    * Yes, Reward is cross-platform. It was written in Golang with intention to support Windows users as well.

* Should I run reward as **root** user or with sudo?

    * Nope, you should almost never use reward as root user or with sudo. The only exception is running
      the `reward self-update` command.

* Is Reward free?

    * Yes, and it's open source as well.

* Can I connect to the database using root user?

    * Yes, run `reward db connect --root`.

### Frequent errors

* `docker api is unreachable`

  If you are sure Docker is running on your system, and you keep getting this error, you should check the following:

    * **Make sure your Docker version is up to date** and meets the system requirements mentioned in the
      [Common Requirements](installation.html#common-requirements) section.
      ``` note::
             Package managers provide outdated Docker versions.
      ```

    * **Your user is not in the `docker` group**, or it cannot reach the docker socket.
        * After you add your user to the docker group ***you will have to reboot*** (or log out and log back in). For
          more info go to the following link:
          [Install Docker Engine in Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)
          See the `If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user` section.

      ``` note::
             You can check if your user is in the docker group with **id** command.
    
             You can make sure your user is able to reach the docker API running **docker ps** (without sudo).
      ```

* `Error: exit status x`

  Most of the cases these errors are coming from the container or docker itself. Reward tries to run a command inside
  the container, and the exit code of the command is not 0, or the container exited during the execution. In most cases
  this error code will be a part of a longer error message which will describe the problem.

---

* `Error: exit status 137`

  During Magento 2 installation (`reward bootstrap`) you will get this error code most likely during
  the `composer install` command. Composer installation needs a huge amount of memory and this error code represents a
  docker `out of memory` error code.

  To solve this problem, you will have to increase the memory limit of Docker Desktop. For more info see:
  [Additional requirements (macOS only)](installation.html#additional-requirements-macos-only)

* ```Error: unable to connect to beta: unable to connect to endpoint: unable to dial agent endpoint: unable to install agent: unable to get agent for platform: unable to locate agent bundle```

  This error message most probably appears if Mutagen is installed on your system but the Mutagen Agents Bundle are
  not. **Check your PATH (like `c:\bin`) and make sure `mutagen.exe` and `mutagen-agents.tar.gz` are there**. If not,
  download the latest release of Mutagen and extract the archive. You will find both files in it.

---

* ```Error: create failed: unable to connect to beta: unable to connect to endpoint: unable to dial agent endpoint: unable to create agent command: unable to probe container: container probing failed under POSIX hypothesis (signal: killed) and Windows hypothesis (signal: killed)```

  If this error occurs, you can try to install mutagen-beta.
    ```
    mutagen daemon stop
    brew uninstall mutagen
    brew install mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen-beta
    ```

---

* ```Error: unable to connect to daemon: client/daemon version mismatch (daemon restart recommended)```

  There's a possibility mutagen was updated on your system. Homebrew update doesn't restart mutagen daemon, try to run
  it manually:
    ```
    mutagen daemon stop
    mutagen daemon start
    ```

---

* `Package hirak/prestissimo has a PHP requirement incompatible with your PHP version, PHP extensions and Composer version`

  If you see this error message during the Magento 2 installation, you will have to downgrade your Composer version.

  To do so, add the following line to the `.env`:
    ```
    COMPOSER_VERSION=1
    ```

  For more information, see the [Composer configuration](customization/composer.md).

---

* `reward shell` stuck or frozen on Windows

  If any of Reward commands seems to be frozen or stuck, and you are using Git Bash on Windows, most probably you faced
  a known issue with Docker for Windows and Git Bash. To solve it, you have to use `winpty` (Windows Pseudo Terminal)
  using the following command:
    ```
    winpty reward shell
    ```

---

* Chrome of Firefox shows `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` or `SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER` error

  If you try to open an environment in your browser and Reward's certificate is not working, most probably you have to
  add Reward's root CA certificate to your browser's CA trust. You can find more information about how to do this in
  the [documentation](installation.html#trusted-ca-root-certificate).

---

* `Error: ErrCannotFindContainer: container cannot be found: traefik` on Linux using Docker Desktop

  If you use Docker Desktop on Linux you have to configure Reward to use Docker Desktop's socket.
  See the [Docker Desktop on Linux](configuration/docker-desktop-on-linux.md) documentation page.

---

* `Error: error terminating mutagen sync: cannot terminate previous sync session: error running command: sh: exit status 1`

  If you see this error message, you have to restart mutagen daemon:
    ```
    mutagen daemon stop
    mutagen daemon start
    ```

---

* `network reward was found but has incorrect label com.docker.compose.network set to "reward"`

  If you see this error message, you should completely restart reward and remove any leftover networks.
  The issue occurs because of the different label handling between docker compose v1 and v2.
    ```
    reward env down
    reward svc down
    docker network prune
    
    # if the above command doesn't work, you can remove the network manually
    # check for existing networks:
    docker network ls --filter 'label=dev.reward.network.name'
  
    # remove the network. eg: docker network rm reward
    docker network rm __network_name__
  
    reward svc up
    reward env up
    ```
